## Hi, I'm Dawid! 👋🏻

I am a junior full stack developer from Bielsko-Biała in Poland. Initially working with front-end technologies and gaining a few clients I noticed that backend is an equally important element in creating advanced websites so I decided to learn it. Apart from programming I also have experience in computer graphics (over 10 years). As for my interests, my passion is road cycling.

### The technologies I use
-- GIT
-- HTML
-- CSS3 *(SCSS, Tailwind, BEM)*
-- JavaScript *(EcmaScript 2015+, jQuery, VueJS)*
-- VueJS *(Vuex, VueRouter, Gridsome, Nuxt)*
-- NodeJS *(ExpressJS, MongoDB)*
-- PHP7
-- Laravel

and... Bootstrap, Bulma, jQuery, Webpack, Gulp, Jade (pug), Composer, NPM, Yarn
