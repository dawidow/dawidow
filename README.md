## Hi, I'm Dawid! 👋🏻

I am a junior full stack developer from Bielsko-Biała in Poland. Initially working with front-end technologies and gaining a few clients I noticed that backend is an equally important element in creating advanced websites so I decided to learn it. Apart from programming I also have experience in computer graphics (over 10 years). As for my interests, my passion is road cycling.

### The technologies I use
-- GIT <br>
-- HTML <br>
-- CSS3 *(SCSS, Tailwind, BEM)* <br>
-- JavaScript *(EcmaScript 2015+, jQuery, VueJS)* <br>
-- VueJS *(Vuex, VueRouter, Gridsome, Nuxt)* <br>
-- NodeJS *(ExpressJS, MongoDB)* <br>
-- PHP7 <br>
-- Laravel <br>

and... Bootstrap, Bulma, jQuery, Webpack, Gulp, Jade (pug), Composer, NPM, Yarn
